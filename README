Requires the TV or other device to have a Flingo-enabled application that pulls
the queue call from the Flingo backend.

  Will serve the file to the TV as long as Flingo Desktop is running.

Build from source for windows
-----------------------------

Obtain the source distribution from the github download page 

  https://github.com/Flingo/Flingo
  
by clicking on "Downloads" on the right-middle of the web page.
A dialog appears and presents options to download source as
a gzipped tar ball (.tar.gz) or a zip file.  Any recent verison of
Windows natively understands .zip files so download the zip file.

Alternatively checkout the latest version using git.

  http://git-scm.com

or checkout the latest version from the github repository using git. 
For example, run the following from the cmd prompt once git has been
installed:

  git clone https://github.com/Flingo/Flingo.git

If you wish to build Flingo Desktop from source, install python 2.6 or later.
Install setuptools, which can be obtained from 

  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Then install py2exe from

  http://www.py2exe.org/

Then install twisted.

  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/

From the command prompt change into the directory where you downloaded
the Flingo Desktop sources.

  cd Flingo\Desktop
  python setup.py

If py2exe fails because you do not have MSVCM90.DLL then at least as
of this writing, you can install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Express
for free from Microsoft.  In my system the necessary DLLs were
installed in the directory  

  C:\Windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft.vc90.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.30729.4974_none_50940634bcb759cb\
